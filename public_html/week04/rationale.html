<h1>Header:</h1>
<p> There was a major change in the header. First of all, I margined the image-header to the top without having any space. Secondly, I changed the layout of the navigation menu with a fixed position. lastly, I added a search bar for the user, which makes it easier to navigate.
</p><br>

<h1>Background:</h1>
<p>I have changed the background for the entire site with an image. The image looks good and attract the user's eye. I also set the background in a fixed position.</p><br>

<h1>Body:</h1>
<p> The body was to wide on the base page, so I had to magrin it and center it to 30px. I also break it down to sections, that way I had the power to style it better, the body looks good and you still can see the background image. The body is set with a static position, so I can scroll up and down using the body only.</p><br>

<h1>Forms:</h1>
<p> I have changed the forms from being titled by names and changed it to placeholder title. This way I saved more space and it looks fancy than before.</p><br>

<h1>Images:</h1>
<p>The images were totally out of control due to the body changes, so I put them in a different class and change the sizes to fit with new body pages.</p>

<h1>Links:</h1>
<p> I had to do some changes also with the links especially the header, since I added the search bar, it was hard to fit all of them in one line-block. However, the change was made to make all of them fit on same line.</p>

<span style="font-size: 28px; font-family: cursive;"> </style>Rationale:</span>
<p> I didn't really know that much about design and this is the first time to design a web. It appeared to be really hard at beginning, but after following the guidelines everything has made sense to me. The guidelines helped me with amazing strategy, which saves my time, effort and it's very important to build a website. I learned about outstanding graphic, design and quality assurance for every website to build. Also, it has helped me to develop the way I think about others and how I can make it useful for them. So these great examples and guidelines gave me the right insights on how to build a website from scratch. </p>
