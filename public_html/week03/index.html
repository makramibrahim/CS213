   <h2>Every Visitor Must Know The 5 Secret Tips</h2>
  <p>Visiting a new country can often be a hassle, particularly if it’s country as complex and as interesting as Egypt is. Knowning for its sunny beach side resorts and one of the most kind ancient monuments, here are 13 tips for visiting Egypt.
  </p>
  </div>
  <div id="p2">
  <P><strong>TAXI</strong><br>
  When taking a taxi, it is best if a visitor asks their travel agency or hotel concierge to call a taxi for them. Usually, hotels and travel agencies have certain assigned taxis they know and have worked with. Visitors should try and form a relationship with a certain taxi driver so that they always have a reliable form of transportation available.</P>
  </div>

  <div id="p3">
  <P><STRONG>DO YOU SPEAK ARABIC?</STRONG><br>
  How to say "No, Thank you": "La’ shukran." Egyptian hospitality knows no limits, when walking down the streets or on tourist sites, many locals, especially souvenir shop owners, will try to get tourists’ attention. "La shukran" is a nice way to say I’m not interested. The Egyptian Arabic pronunciation: La’ SHUK-ran.</P>
  </div>

  <div id="p4">
 <p><strong>LET PEOPLE KNOW WHERE YOU ARE</strong><br> 
  When traveling alone or independent of a travel agency, let your hotel know where you are going. In case of an emergency, your hotel representatives will know where to look for you or contact you. Also, getting the exact address and phone number of both the place you are going to and your hotel will save you time and will ensure that you are transported to the exact location you wanted.</p>
  </div>

  <div id="p5">
 <p><strong> EXCHANGE RATES</strong><br>
  Ideally, visitors should carry most of their money in Egyptian pounds as they will use the Egyptian currency the most. Most souvenir shops, grocery stores and day to day expenses will require visitors to pay in Egyptian pounds. Paying in their own currency will be a possibility; however, in this case, the shop owner will be the one to decide the exchange rate. As a result, visitors may end up to paying more than is required of them</p>
  </div>

  <div id="p6">
  <p><strong>BEWARE: SCAMMERS</strong><br>
  When arriving at the Giza Pyramids complex, you may be told that you cannot walk or drive to the pyramids and that you must take a horse or a camel instead. This is false. There have been cases in which foreigners have been told that they cannot drive or walk to the pyramids complex by local camel and horse operators. This is just a way for them to make profit.</p>
